Last year I completed courses in basic Html and css. At the beginning of 2022, I found courses from RSSchool. I signed up for Stage-1, but in the process I realized that my knowledge was not enough. 

I was glad this fall I learned about Stage-0. I hope this course will help me reach a higher level of knowledge and go to study further
